# A Nethack APIs for iv4XR

It contains the following:

   1. The class  `MyEnv`. This is the interface between the agents and Nethack.

   2. The class `TacticLib` you will find a handful of typical tactics to
   implement. Tactics are needed so that your agents can operate at much higher level of control rather than literally at the level of primitive actions provided by `MyEnv`.

   3. The class `GoalLib`, provides a number of typical goal-structures that you can use for composing your testing tasks.

   4. The class `A_SimpleExample_of_Test_Using_TestAgent` shows a single test (with JUnit), using an iv4XR test-agent and components named above.
